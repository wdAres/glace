                                representations regarding such subject matter. Except as herein provided, no waiver,
                                modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective against
                                EcoEx unless the same is in writing and signed by an authorized official of EcoEx. EcoEx
                                may modify these terms and conditions at any time upon written notice or by posting the
                                modified terms and conditions in the Site. You agree that if you use the Services after
                                such notification of changes in the Agreement, you will be bound by all such changes. At
                                the time of such modification, you will have the opportunity to reject such
                                modification, which rejection shall constitute a termination of this Agreement and of
                                your rights to access and use the Site, Services and Information. Should any term or

                                remaining terms and provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
